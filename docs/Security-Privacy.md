# Security & Privacy â€” Diffly

- **No servers** used in v1; all logic runs locally in browser.
- No analytics by default; if added, use privacy-preserving (self-hosted or consent-gated).
- CSP headers recommended if a backend is ever introduced.
- If file upload added in v2, never store files by default; process in memory; provide explicit "Share" with warning.
